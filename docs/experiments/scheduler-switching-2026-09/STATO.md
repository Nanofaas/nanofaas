# Scheduler switching campaign — status

## 2026-09-19 — Task 0: baseline frozen; P25 closure recorded as an operator decision

**P25 is not measured closed.** The lifecycle-memory campaign's own status file
(`docs/experiments/lifecycle-memory-2026-09/STATO.md`) ends with an entry dated 2026-09-19
stating the campaign is **incomplete**. The paired requalification that entry names as the
missing prerequisite — a `memory-soak-sync-container.yaml` run at `e35405ee` and again at the
P24 candidate revision, evaluated with the harness fix from that same entry — has **not been
run**. P24's own candidate-only diagnostic (revision
`758d135b8c1b2e7483ae07c96173c51db2510a74`) measured `p24_qualified: false`: two JVM
rss-return criteria fail (control-plane 224.5 MB → 496.4 MB drain maximum; word-stats-java
249.3 MB → 251.9 MB), against the frozen zero-tolerance policy. The JavaScript defect P24 set
out to find is confirmed fixed by measurement.

**Closure, as it actually happened:** the project operator declared P25 closed on **2026-09-19**,
so that this plan (manual scheduler switching, issue #208) may proceed. This is a decision made
by the operator, not a measurement performed by this task, by P24, or by any other entry in the
lifecycle-memory `STATO.md`. Nothing in this repository shows the paired soak having been run,
and nothing here should be read as claiming it was. **The soak was not executed. The campaign
was not measured closed. P24/P25 did not qualify by the frozen policy's own criteria.**

**Attribution limit this leaves for the scheduler-switching work.** Because the paired
requalification never ran, there is no clean pre-scheduler-work memory/latency baseline for the
candidate revision this plan builds on. If a memory or latency regression is observed later in
this campaign, it cannot be cleanly attributed between the scheduler-switching changes and the
still-unqualified candidate revision inherited from lifecycle-memory — the two are confounded
until the missing paired soak is run. Later tasks in this plan should treat any such regression
as ambiguous in origin, not as evidence against the scheduler work specifically, unless the
paired soak is run first to separate the two.

**Task 0 is the only task in this plan authorised to proceed under this declaration**, and it
changed no production code (`src/main` untouched). It froze:

- the baseline (`BASELINE.md`): revision `05f49dcb`, host, three test profiles, GitNexus symbol
  analysis with callers/risk/epistemic per symbol, all UNKNOWN/lower-bound results resolved by
  text search;
- the performance budgets (`budgets.json`), copied value-for-value from the task brief;
- the architectural contract (`docs/architecture/0002-manual-scheduler-switching.md`), which
  records the lock order and the concurrency hazard that Task 4 is scheduled to close.

## What this file does not cover

It is not a re-run or re-evaluation of the P24 measurement, and it performs no new memory-soak
measurement. It records the state Task 0 inherited and the decision that let it proceed.
